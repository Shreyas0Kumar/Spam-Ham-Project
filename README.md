# Spam-Ham-Project
Classification project 

Small project in python using machine learning to detect whether a given text is spam or ham.
In this project for pre processing the text data, I had used "nltk" to remove the common words from the message.
Then converted my text data to vector and after that usses some of the sklearn modes to see which one fits best for my project.
